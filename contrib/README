This `contrib` directory is a place for things that are not a part of gr1c per
se but are still closely dependent and generally useful.  Some of the material
here is under separate copyright and licenses (but always open source) from that
of gr1c.  Below is a summary of contents.

* readjson.py:
  Python script reading JSON output from gr1c.  Notable dependencies are
  NetworkX (http://networkx.lanl.gov) and matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org).

* gen4g.py:
  Generate specification fragments modeling gridworlds.
